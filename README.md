## Data cleaning 

I deleted the empty values, searched for duplicates, renamed the columns with appropriate names, deleted the columns that I did not need in the analysis, and changed the type of some variables such as date.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the  data to answer key questions, such as:
What are the most popular locations and room types? 
How has the evaluation been over the years?
What are the average room prices according to location and room type?
 
## Data Analysis

Include some code with python libraries like
pandas 
numpy
matplotlib 

## Results 

We find that the rating increases over the years.

I found that the Manhattan location and the room type, Entire Home, are the most available and the highest host.

 Regarding the average price, we find that the location, Manhattan, and the room type, Entire Home, are higher in price compared to others This may explain why it is the most available
 Or it is not in high demand.

 As for the average number of nights, we find that the shared room type is the lowest by 27%. followed by private room by 28% Then entire home by 44%.
